> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for Bastian Allgeier's Kirby framework

## Getting Started

#### Note: this generator requires Git to work, please make sure that it is installed.

To install from NPM, run:

```
$ npm install -g yo generator-kirby
```

Initiate the generator:

```
$ yo kirby
```

1. Select a folder for Kirby to be set up in.
2. Configure some stuff such as license key, site name, author, etc.
3. Decide whether or not to set up the Kirby panel.
4. Decide whether or not to set up the blog.
5. Decide whether or not to set up the contact form.
5. Start testing and developing by running `php -S localhost:8080` or using MAMP, XAMPP, WAMP, etc.

## License

I'm not going to put a complicated license here because I want as many people to enjoy from this as possible. Just a couple of things to keep in mind:
  1. This is free, public code and its purpose is to help people.
  2. You can use this as much as you want, modify it, distribute it, and whatever else, but don't charge for it, and don't say you made it if you haven't contributed a significant amount.
  3. I'll try to help solve any issues in any way I can, but I make no promises. I try to write tests to make sure that the generator works, but that doesn't mean things can go wrong. If something does, just make an issue and I or someone else will hopefully be your shining knight.
  4. If you want something to be added, please do your due diligence. I try to go back and comment the code every so often, so before you ask for a feature to be added, see if you can submit a pull request.
